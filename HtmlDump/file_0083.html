</ul><h2><a id=\"information-for-support\" name=\"information-for-support\"></a>What information should I provide when contacting user support?</h2><p>When you submit a support request, it helps if you always provide:
</p><ol>
	<li>your VSC user ID (or VUB netID),</li>
	<li>contact information - it helps to specify your preferred mail address and phone number for contact,</li>
	<li>an informative subject line for your request,</li>
	<li>the time the problem occurred,</li>
	<li>the steps you took to resolve the problem.</li>
</ol><p>Below, you will find more useful information you can provide for various categories of problems you may encounter. Although it may seem like more work to you, it will often save a few iterations and get your problem solved faster.
</p><h3>If you have problems logging in to the system</h3><p>then provide the following information:
</p><ol>
	<li>your operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows, MacOS X, ...),</li>
	<li>your client software (e.g., PuTTY, OpenSSH, ...),</li>
	<li>your location (e.g., on campus, at home, abroad),</li>
	<li>whether the problem is systematic (how many times did you try, over which period) or intermittent,</li>
	<li>any error messages shown by the client software, or an error log if it is available.</li>
</ol><h3>If installed software malfunctions/crashes</h3><p>then provide the following information:
</p><ol>
	<li>the name of the application (e.g., Ansys, Matlab, R, ...),</li>
	<li>the module(s) you load to use the software (e.g., R/3.1.2-intel-2015a),</li>
	<li>the error message the application produces,</li>
	<li>whether the error is reproducible,</li>
	<li>if possible, a procedure and data to reproduce the problem,</li>
	<li>if the application was run as a job, the jobID(s) of (un)successful runs.</li>
</ol><h3>If your own software malfunctions/crashes</h3><p>then provide the following information:
</p><ol>
	<li>the location of the source code,</li>
	<li>the error message produced at build time or runtime,</li>
	<li>the toolchain and other module(s) you load to build the software (e.g., intel/2015a with HDF5/1.8.4-intel-2015a),</li>
	<li>if possible and applicable, a procedure and data to reproduce the problem,</li>
	<li>if the software was run as a job, the jobID(s) of (un)successful runs.</li>
</ol>"
